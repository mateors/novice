## String interpolation
#### What is meant by string interpolation?
> In computer programming, string interpolation (or variable interpolation, variable substitution, or variable expansion) is the process of evaluating a string literal containing one or more placeholders, yielding a result in which the placeholders are replaced with their corresponding values.


## How is string interpolation performed?
> String interpolation is a process of injecting value into a placeholder (a placeholder is nothing but a variable to which you can assign data/value later) in a string literal. It helps in dynamically formatting the output in a fancier way

* fmt.Sprintf("my name is %v", name)
* fmt.Printf("my age is %d", 20)

#### In javascript
let name="Mostain" \
let age=20 
> its a string template like `"My name is ${name} I am ${age} years old"`

## Benefit
* Readability -> String interpolation has the obvious benefit of higher readability
* Scalability -> scales better
